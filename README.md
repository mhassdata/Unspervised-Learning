##Wholesale Product Clustering Results
This repository presents the results of applying K-Means clustering to a wholesale product dataset, providing insights into customer purchase behavior. The dataset contains customer purchase data for various product categories, with each row representing a customer and the columns indicating purchase values.

The K-Means clustering identified three customer segments based on their preferences:

Cluster 1: "Fresh & Delicassen Lovers" - Customers inclined towards fresh produce and delicatessen items.
Cluster 2: "Dairy & Grocery Enthusiasts" - Customers with a preference for dairy and grocery products.
Cluster 3: "Dairy & Frozen Fans" - Customers showing a liking for dairy and frozen products.
Businesses can leverage these insights to tailor marketing strategies, optimize inventory, and enhance customer satisfaction. However, it's important to consider the limitations of K-Means and ensure proper data preprocessing for accurate results. Overall, these clustering results provide valuable guidance for data-driven decision-making in the wholesale product market.
